# Analysis-of-Movie-Audience-s-Patterns
This is a group assignment in which we are required to obtain our dataset from MovieLens-1M. The topic is open and thus we decided to analyse on the audiences' patterns based on their choice of movie. Many methods were used top reach our objective ie : word cloud, distributions, coeficient correlation, and chart visualisations.
