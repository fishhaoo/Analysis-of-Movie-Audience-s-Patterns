# Analysis-of-Movie-Audience-s-Patterns
# Assignment
This is a group assignment in which we are required to obtain our dataset from MovieLens-1M. The topic is open and thus we decided to analyse on the audiences' patterns based on their choice of movie. 
We chose 2 topics to major in in which they are :
1. Correlation between movie ratings and age groups
2. List of movies that fall above the upper quartile of the variable 'ratings'

Many methods were used top reach our objective ie : word cloud, distributions, coeficient correlation, and chart visualisations.
